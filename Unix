Question 1


a) A company requires a program to enter employee name, hours worked and rate per hour of an employee then calculate basic pay. Tax is calculated on basic pay as follows:

Basic pay

Over 70000

Tax

25% of basic pay

Between 15000 and 15% of basic pay 70000

Below 15000

No tax

Write a shell script that will enable the user to implement the following.

i. Prompt the user to enter employee name, hours worked and rate per hour

ii.

Calculate the basic

pay (basic pay = hours worked * rate per hour)

iii. Use an if-else

statement to calculate tax based on basic pay to meet the stipulated requirements shown in the table above

iv. Calculate the net pay (net pay = basic pay - tax)


#!bin/bash

read -p "Enter employee name: " name

read -p "Enter hours worked: hours

read -p "Enter rate per hour: "rate

basic_pay=$((bc<<<"$hours*$rate") if($basic_pay-gt 70000"); then tax=$($bc<<<"basic_pay*0.25") elif($basic_pay-gt 15000);then tax=$(bc<<<$basic_pay *0.25")

else tax=0

fi

net_pay=$(bc<<<"$basic_pay-$tax);

echo Employee Name: $name"

echo"Basic pay: $$basic_pay"

echo"Tax:$$tax"

echo"Net pay:$$net_pay"


question 2

a) A system call is a controlled entry point into the kernel, allowing a process to request that the kernel perform some action on the process's behalf.

To demonstrate a system call, Write a C program that opens a file, writes "Hello World" to it, reads the content back, and then prints the read content. Finally, close the file. Ensure you document (comment) every line of code in your program.

#include <stdio.h> int main()

{

FILE *fptr, //Declare a file pointer

//open a file named "hello.txt" in write mode ("w')

//if the file does not exist, it will be create

if(fptr ==NULL){ Printf("Error! could not open file.\n");

return 1;

//writes the string hello world" to the opened file

fprintf(fptr, "Hello world \n");

//Rewinds the file pointer to the begging of the file rewind(fptr);

char buffer[50]; //Declares a charater array to

store read content

//Reads content from file into the buffer fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), fptr);

printf("content of the file: %\n", buffer); //Prints the read content from buffer fclose(fptr); //Closes the file return 0;

}





Question 3

a) You are tasked with creating a shell script to calculate and display the electricity bill for a given customer based on the units consumed. The program should consider different charging rates and apply surcharges. as specified. Implement the program using the provided criteria. The charges are as follow:

Units

upto 199

Charges per unit (Ksh)

120

200 and above but less 150

than 400 400 and above but less 180

than 600

600 and above 200

Write a shell script to implement the following

Prompt the user to enter CustomerID, CustomerName and

UnitConsumed Use an if..else statement to

check the above given conditions and apply the necessary calculations iil

Calculate the total bill



#!bin/bash

read -p "Enter customerID: customer_id

read -p "Enter customer Name:"

customer_name

read -p "Enter units consumed:" units

if($units -le 199);then

charge_per-unit=120

elif($units -It 400); then

charge_per_unit=150 elif(Sunits -It 600); then

charge_per_unit=180

else

charge_per_unit=200

fi

total_bill=$(bc<<<"Sunits*Scharge_per_unit")

echo "Customer ID:$customer_id"

echo "customer Name:$customer_name"

echo "Units consumed: Sunits" echo "Charge per unit: $charge_per_unit"

echo "Total Bill: Ksh Stotal-bill"
